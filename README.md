# HexWorld
This project is an implementation of an endless hex tile world generation system in Unity. It utilizes chunk loading/unloading system for efficient rendering and optimization, as well as a pathfinding algorithm for navigating the generated world using Unity's DOTS. The project aims to provide a foundation for creating vast and procedurally generated hex tile-based environments.
